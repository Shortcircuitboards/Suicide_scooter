# Suicide_scooter
Brushless mod for the Razor kiddy Scooter. It´s kinda dumb, because it´s way too fast for the little breaks and the stupid mecanic. But i got it cheap and also the other
parts... So i build it anyway :-)

Needed Parts:
- Printed Housing for the Handle
- Arduino Nano https://cutt.ly/gC3ZU4s
- 0,96" 128x64 OLED display (You have to adjust the Adress, if you buy the original Adafruit one!)  https://www.banggood.com/custlink/GKmcCJi8Bf
- 1 Pushbutton
- Resistors for the Voltagedivider 1,2K and 10K
- 2 Pulldown resistors for the Switches 100k
- Currentsensor SCT-013 (100A) https://cutt.ly/hC3ZhM8
- 2Ch Relay Module https://www.banggood.com/custlink/GKvrcp98AO
- 120A RedBrick ESC https://cutt.ly/dC3Lajt
- NTM Brushless motor
- A few metal Adaptors, to fit the Motor in the Scooter
- 3x 6S2P Liion 18650 Battery (or any kinda Battery you can find as long as it can handle the current and don´t exceed 6S)
- Servo Extension wires https://cutt.ly/CC3LIFR
- Printed Part for the Break/Rearlight assembly
- Printed Part for the Frontlight
- DC/DC Converter with 12V Output https://www.banggood.com/custlink/3GvJWCZ8Ap
- DC/DC Converter with 5V Output https://www.banggood.com/custlink/3GvJWCZ8Ap
- Some Capacitors to Buffer the Systemvoltages on the Arduino (to drive it smoother... otherwise it will react to every shit in the onboard voltage system!!)
- White LED Stripe or/and Power LED https://cutt.ly/AC3L4dA
- Red LED Stripe 12V https://cutt.ly/oC3LL3e
- Colored LED Stripe for the Underfloor lights (to make that scooter fanzy!!)
