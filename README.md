# Suicide_scooter
Brushless mod for the Razor kiddy Scooter. It´s kinda dumb, because it´s way too fast for the little breaks and the stupid mecanic. But i got it cheap and also the other
parts... So i build it anyway :-)

Actually done:
- Light switch
- Brakelight
- stop motor, when brake pulled
- Oled display with throttle
- smoothen out the max throttle to save the ESC from exploding
- gott the hardware ready to test out everything in real :-D (minor bugfixes comming soon)

Partitially done:
- configuration script

To be done:
- different speed modes while switching on (pull break, while switching on, for unlimited speed, all normal for limited [legal...] speed
- change color for the underfloor LED stirp with button combination
